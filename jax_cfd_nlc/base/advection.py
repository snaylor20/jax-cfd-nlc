def _advect_aligned(cs: GridVariableVector, v: GridVariableVector) -> GridArray:
  """Computes fluxes and the associated advection for aligned `cs` and `v`.

  The values `cs` should consist of a single quantity `c` that has been
  interpolated to the offset of the components of `v`. The components of `v` and
  `cs` should be located at the faces of a single (possibly offset) grid cell.
  We compute the advection as the divergence of the flux on this control volume.

  The boundary condition on the flux is inherited from the scalar quantity `c`.

  A typical example in three dimensions would have

  ```
  cs[0].offset == v[0].offset == (1., .5, .5)
  cs[1].offset == v[1].offset == (.5, 1., .5)
  cs[2].offset == v[2].offset == (.5, .5, 1.)

  In this case, the returned advection term would have offset `(.5, .5, .5)`.

  Args:
    cs: a sequence of `GridArray`s; a single value `c` that has been
      interpolated so that it is aligned with each component of `v`.
    v: a sequence of `GridArrays` describing a velocity field. Should be defined
      on the same Grid as cs.

  Returns:
    An `GridArray` containing the time derivative of `c` due to advection by

  Implements Van-Leer flux limiting scheme that uses second order accurate
  approximation of fluxes for smooth regions of the solution. This scheme is
  total variation diminishing (TVD). For regions with high gradients flux
  limitor transformes the scheme into a first order method. For [1] for
  reference. This function follows the following procedure:

    1. Shifts c to offset < 1 if necessary.
    2. Scalar c now has a well defined right-hand (upwind) value.
    3. Computes upwind flux for each direction.
    4. Computes van leer flux limiter:
      a. Use the shifted c to interpolate each component of `v` to the
        right-hand (upwind) face of the control volume centered on  `c`.
      b. Compute the ratio of successive gradients:
        In nonperiodic case, the value outside the boundary is not defined.
        Mode is used to interpolate past the boundary.
      c. Compute flux limiter function.
      d. Computes higher order flux correction.
    5. Combines fluxes and assigns flux boundary condition.
    6. Computes the negative divergence of fluxes.
    7. Shifts the computed values back to original offset of c.

  Args:
    c: the quantity to be transported.
    v: a velocity field. Should be defined on the same Grid as c.
    dt: time step for which this scheme is TVD and second order accurate
      in time.
    mode: For non-periodic BC, specifies extrapolation of values beyond the
      boundary, which is used by nonlinear interpolation.

  Returns:
    The time derivative of `c` due to advection by `v`.
