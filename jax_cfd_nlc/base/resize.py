  """Downsamples `u`, an array of velocities in the given `direction`.

  Downsampling consists of the following steps:
    * Establish new downsampled control volumes. Each will consist of
      `factor ** dimension` of the fine-grained control volumes.
    * Discard all of the `u` values that do not lie on a face of the new control
      volume in `direction`.
    * Compute the mean of all `u` values that lie on each control volume face in
      the given `direction`.

  This procedure guarantees that if our source velocity has zero divergence
  (i.e., corresponds to an incompressible flow), the downsampled velocity field
  also has zero divergence.

  For example,

  ```
  u = [[0, 1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6, 7],
       [8, 9, 10, 11],
       [12, 13, 14, 15]]

  assert w == np.array([[4.5, 6.5],
                        [12.5, 14.5]])
  ```

  Args:
    u: an array of velocity values.
    direction: an integer indicating the direction of the velocities `u`.
    factor: the factor by which to downsample.

  Returns:
    Coarse-grained array, reduced in size by ``factor`` along each dimension.

  Downsampling consists of the following steps:

  This procedure corresponds to standard top-hat filter + comb downsampling.

  Note that the filter size does not have to equal the factor difference between
  the two grids. The intended use case is for filter size >= factor.

  Args:
    source_grid: the grid of variable u. Note: this is legacy implementation,
      variables[i] is an instance of GridVariable and has a grid attribute.
    destination_grid: the grid on which to interpolate filtered variables.
    variables: a tuple of GridVariables. Note that the  grid attribute of each
      variable has to agree with source_grid.
    filter_size: the number of grid points used in the filter. If it's an int,
      it specifies the same number of points to filter in all directions. If it
      is a tuple. each direction is specified separately.
